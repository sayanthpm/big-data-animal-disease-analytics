# 🐄 Big Data Analytics on Animal Disease Dataset using Apache Hive & Hadoop

This project applies **big data analytics** to a global **animal disease dataset** using the **Hadoop ecosystem**, including **Apache Hive**, **HiveQL**, and distributed storage via **HDFS**. It was developed as part of my B.E. in Information Science and Engineering at **JSS Science and Technology University (SJCE), Mysuru)**.

The goal of this project is to analyze disease patterns, seasonal trends, and region-wise outbreak behavior, and explore predictive insights to support veterinary health, livestock management, and public health planning.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Apache Hive** – Distributed SQL querying  
- **HiveQL** – SQL-like data processing language  
- **Hadoop / HDFS** – Distributed file system for large datasets  
- **MapReduce (via Hive execution engine)** – Batch processing backend  
- **Kaggle Animal Disease Dataset**

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze global animal disease datasets using distributed data processing  
- Perform large-scale ETL operations with Hive  
- Identify disease trends across **species**, **regions**, and **years**  
- Explore seasonal patterns in outbreaks  
- Generate predictive insights using historical trends  
- Demonstrate the capability of big data tools in scientific/public health applications

📥 Dataset Information
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maryam18/animal-disease-classification

-The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes:

-Species

-Disease

-Region

-Year

-Outbreak Count

Due to Kaggle licensing rules, the dataset is not included in this repository.
Users may obtain it directly from Kaggle and load it into their Hadoop environment.
